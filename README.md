RMIT Assignment - Algorithms and Analysis

There are three key objectives for this assignment:
- Understand how a real problem can be mapped to various representations and their
operations.
- Use a number of fundamental data structures to implement the runqueue abstract
data type.
- Evaluate and contrast the performance of the data structures with respect to different
usage scenarios and input data.
